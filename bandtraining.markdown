If you have played in a band you probably know the feeling of <strong>losing track of time and space</strong>, because you’re so immersed in the music that you feel like one with the others.

This course is about being in that zone <strong>every time</strong> we play – playing music together as <strong>one single unit</strong>. We will practice to be more focused listeners, which means learning to hear the details in the music as well as the sound of the whole band, and being <strong>ready for action</strong> when the music takes a new direction. 


I have designed <strong>exercises</strong> that everyone can do, irrespective of their instrumental skill level, and they are also easy for other teachers to replicate. The exercises are often based on imitation and repetitive actions, and they teach us to <strong>let go when playing</strong> together. It’s about building a conception of a joint listening position, and learning how social constructs affects musical interaction. 



I have a masters degree in piano and music performance from the respected Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen. For the past 5 years I have been teaching groups ranging from <strong>primary schools</strong> to conservatory level students and <strong>professional musicians</strong>. I’ve effectively worked with these methods to inspire musical experiences that went on to <strong>engender trust and bonds</strong> between people from diverse background. 

I would like to share my methods with you. <strong>Get in touch</strong> with me if you are interested in knowing more!
