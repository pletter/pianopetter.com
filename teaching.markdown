## Piano tutoring

I teach piano, composing and improvising from my home in Maindee, Newport. As my piano student, you will be learning your favorite songs, as well as learning to improvise and play solo, and writing your own tunes. 

Playing music is about enjoyment, and having fun being you. We don’t do test or examinations, but together we make a plan, and do our best to reach your goals. 

We are all musically gifted with ears we use day in and day out, we just need to activate them for playing. I believe when we give our ears time to taste which notes we like, everyone has the ability to build their own musical universe and language. 

I have a masters degree in piano and music performance from the respected Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen, and during the last 5 years I have been lucky enough to have been touring and teaching music in Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Nigeria, South Africa and Israel/Palestine. Now I’m living in Newport where except for playing concerts and teaching, I’m also making youtube videos about composing music. 

All of my methods for learning piano are designed to work for all ages and levels.

If you wanna learn to play piano – better call Petter!!! 

<em> "I feel very fortunate to have found Petter! His teaching is creative, encouraging and very inspirational. Each week i come away feeling totally amazed by what i have achieved in the lesson. I highly recommend him" - Carmela Gianfagna
</em>

<em>“Petter is a very focused and present teacher, who has  led me through some of my most hardcore obstacles in my music with ease, and I can strongly recommend him to everyone that wants to get through with music. He’s is crazy, brave and it’s easy to feel, that all he wishes for is for me to succeed!” - Johan Ransby Granberg
