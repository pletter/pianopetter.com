## Piano tutoring

I teach piano, composing and improvising from my home in Maindee, Newport.   

As my piano student, you will be learning your favorite songs, as well as learning to improvise and play solo, and writing your own tunes.   

Playing music is about enjoyment, and having fun being you. We don’t do test or examinations, but together we will do our best to reach your goals. We come up with a plan for what you want learn, that we revisit once a month, in order to make sure we are on a path you feel good with.  

I have a masters degree in piano and music performance at the respected Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen, and since I started working as musician I’ve kept developing my methods for teaching how to play the piano. During the last 5 years I have been touring and teaching music in Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Nigeria, South Africa and Israel/Palestine. Now I’m living in Newport where except for playing concerts and teaching, I’m also making youtube videos about composing music.  

We are all musically gifted with ears we use day in and day out, we just need to activate them for playing. I believe when we give our ears time to taste which notes we like, everyone has the ability to build their own musical universe and personal language.  

I recommend taking full hour lessons. During that time there is space for playing together, improvisation, working on our own composition as well as working on new songs that we love.  

All of my methods for learning piano are designed to work for all ages and levels. My rates are 30 pounds per hour or 18 pounds for 30 min.  

At my website pianopetter.com you can book a 15 pound test lesson, but you can also write me a message or email, or call me if you wanna know more!  

If you wanna learn to play piano – better call Petter!!!
