I teach piano lessons from my home in <strong>Maindee, Newport.</strong> 

Playing music is about enjoyment, and <strong>having fun being you</strong>! We don’t do test or examinations, but together we <strong>make a plan</strong>, and do our best to reach <strong>your goals.</strong> 

<strong>We are all musically gifted</strong> with ears we use day in and day out, we just need to activate them for playing. I believe when we give our ears time to taste which notes we like, everyone has the ability to build their <strong>own musical universe</strong> and language. 

Young and old, beginner or Mozart – <strong>everyone is welcome!</strong>
