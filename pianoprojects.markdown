<h2>Nana Rashid & Petter Rylén Duo</h2>
<div markdown="1">
During the last year I have been playing extensively with <strong>Danish jazz singer Nana Rashid</strong>, and our concerts have been well recieved: 

<em>“The magical voice of Rashid, in close interplay with the playful piano playing and careful crooning of Rylén, caused both tears, chills and palpitations for the audience”</em> - Vossa Jazz

<em>“I have previously compared the duo with the «Fairytales» duo, the legendary collaboration between the Norwegian vocalist Radka Toneff and the pianist Steve Dobrogosz. Because there is something about the strong voice of Nana Rashid, and Ryléns beautiful piano playing, that reminds me of this duo.”</em> - Jan Granlie, Salt Peanuts 

We're recording our first album as a duo in January, but we recorded EP with a quartet in 2016, called "<strong>Sorrow in Sunlight</strong>".

2016-2017 I spent <strong>a crazy year in Lagos, Nigeria</strong>, where I was playing music and working on this project, aiming to make live music more accesible to local communities.

For many years, until we broke up in 2015, <strong>all I did</strong> was working with this trio. I miss them a lot.

    <h2>Keps</h2>
<div markdown="1">
Keps is my high-school friends hiphop/pop star dream. We had an <strong>immense potential</strong> but didn't quite make it all the way. Nevertheless, we did a lot of <a href="https://keps.github.io">fun projects</a> together, such as a podcast, a comic strip, a crowdfunding campaign and much more. And a music video:

Just <strong>a few excerpts</strong> of all the weird things I've done!
    
After thousands of swipes without any matches on the dating app <strong>Tinder</strong>, I decided to add to my bio: <strong>"Writing a personal love song for every match"</strong>. That did the trick, and I ended up writing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9pDg3pk_kC1QwYTJsnmh1w/">35 heart breaking love songs.</a>

I was part of a band called <strong>"The Great International Band Blyblublible"</strong> which explored the boundaries between performance art and music:

And last but not least – possibly <strong>my biggest Youtube success to date</strong> (altough according to <a href="https://www.rightthisminute.com/video/rtmtv-manscaping-ideas-we-dont-recommend">this viral link tv-show </a> in the US it was my biggest failure)!
